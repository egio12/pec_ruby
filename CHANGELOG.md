and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.3] - 2025-07-14

### Changed
- **ðŸš€ Ruby Way Behavior**: **BREAKING CHANGE** - Method behavior now follows Ruby conventions:
  - `subject/from/to/date` â†’ Returns most relevant content (postacert.eml if available, otherwise PEC envelope)
  - `original_subject/from/to/date` â†’ Always returns PEC envelope information
  - `postacert_body_*` â†’ Direct access to postacert.eml content
  - `raw_body_*` â†’ Smart methods that work with both received and sent messages

### Added
- **Smart attachment access**: New `attachments` and `regular_attachments` methods for intuitive access
- **Folder management**: Added `available_folders`, `select_folder`, and `select_inbox` methods
- **Enhanced body access**: `postacert_body_*` methods for direct postacert.eml access
- **Backward compatibility**: All legacy `original_*` methods maintained as aliases
- **Professional CLI interface**: Complete redesign with full-screen layout and fixed header
- **CLI folder selection**: Interactive folder picker with current selection indicator
- **Interactive message viewer**: Menu-driven navigation with message options
- **Performance timing**: Real-time load time display for user feedback
- **Progress indicators**: Visual feedback for all CLI operations
- **Enhanced attachment management**: Batch download with progress tracking
- **Screen management**: Added `tty-screen` dependency for professional layout

### Removed
- **`pec_messages` method**: Removed redundant method. Use `messages` instead

### Fixed
- **Method naming consistency**: All methods now follow Ruby naming conventions
- **Sent message support**: `raw_body_*` methods now work seamlessly with sent messages
- **Test coverage**: Comprehensive test suite updated for new behavior

### Migration Notes
- Most existing code will continue to work due to backward compatibility
- For PEC envelope data, use `original_*` methods
- For postacert.eml data, use `postacert_*` methods or legacy `original_*` aliases
- The new behavior is more intuitive: `message.subject` returns what users expect to see

## [0.2.2] - 2025-07-13

### Fixed
- **CLI body display bug**: Fixed `NoMethodError` when displaying message body in CLI where `original_body` hash was treated as string
- **Message ordering in CLI**: Fixed message sorting to properly show newest messages first by date instead of sequence number

### Changed
- **CLI improvements**: Increased message limit from 20 to 50 messages for better user experience
- **Text formatting**: Enhanced body text formatting with smart quote normalization and line ending cleanup

### Added
- Better text readability in CLI with automatic formatting improvements
- Proper handling of different character encodings in message body display

## [0.2.1] - 2025-07-13

### Fixed
- **Fixed forwarded postacert.eml detection**: Now correctly detects and processes postacert.eml files that are forwarded as attachments in nested MESSAGE/RFC822 structures
- Improved nested postacert part ID detection algorithm to handle complex IMAP message structures

### Added
- Comprehensive test suite for nested postacert detection scenarios
- Performance optimizations with memoization for attachment calculations
- Enhanced error handling for malformed IMAP structures
- Support for environment variable configuration (`PEC_HOST`, `PEC_USERNAME`, `PEC_PASSWORD`)
- Security improvements to prevent credential leaks in test files

### Changed
- **Code refactoring**: Unified duplicate postacert detection methods into single parameterized method
- **Performance**: Added memoization to `original_attachments`, `nested_postacerts`, and `nested_postacert_attachments` methods
- **Security**: Test files now use environment variables instead of hardcoded credentials
- Improved robustness of bodystructure parsing with defensive programming techniques

### Security
- Removed all hardcoded credentials from test files
- Added `.env.example` for secure configuration
- Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent accidental credential commits
- Added security documentation in README

## [0.2.0] - 2025-07-13

### Changed
- **Breaking Change**: `original_body` now returns a hash with format information instead of plain text
  - Hash contains: `content`, `content_type`, and `charset` keys
  - Allows proper handling of HTML vs plain text content
  - Preserves original formatting for correct display

### Added  
- `original_body_text` method for getting plain text content only
- `original_body_html` method for getting HTML content only
- Enhanced body format detection and handling
- Better charset handling for international content
- **Nested postacert.eml support** for handling forwarded PECs
  - `Attachment#postacert?` to detect postacert.eml attachments
  - `Attachment#as_postacert_message` to parse nested PECs
  - `Message#nested_postacerts` to get nested postacert attachments
  - `Message#original_regular_attachments` to get non-postacert attachments
  - `Message#has_nested_postacerts?` to check for nested PECs
  - `Message#nested_postacert_messages` to get parsed nested messages
  - `Message#all_postacert_messages` for hierarchical view of all messages
- `PecRuby::NestedPostacertMessage` class for nested postacert handling
  - Full API compatibility with original message methods
  - Support for multi-level nesting (postacert within postacert)
  - Automatic detection and parsing of deeper nesting levels

## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-13

### Added
- Initial release of PecRuby gem
- IMAP client for connecting to Italian PEC servers
- Automatic extraction of postacert.eml attachments
- Message parsing and decoding functionality
- Attachment management with download capabilities
- Command-line interface (CLI) for interactive exploration
- Comprehensive error handling
- Support for flexible installation (with/without CLI dependencies)
- Complete API documentation
- Example usage files

### Features
